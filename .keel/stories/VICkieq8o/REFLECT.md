## Observations

Added immutable point mutation APIs to `ProllyTreeBuilder`. Insert and delete traverse the existing root to one target leaf, rewrite the modified leaf chunks, and propagate replacement child entries through the ancestor path to return a new root digest without mutating acknowledged nodes.
